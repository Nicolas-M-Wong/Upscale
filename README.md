# Upscale
This program is upscaling any image by a factor 2. You may need to install the following libraries to run the program:
 - tqdm
 - itertools
 - opencv  
 
The UPSCALE.py is the main code, enregistrement.py and traitement_image_lib.py are referenced as libraries in UPSCALE, for ease of use put these three files in the same folder.  
  
The standard name of the upscaled photo is __fraise4.jpg__ . It can be renamed inside the python code of the file name UPSCALE.py.  

Ongoing development :
 - *Translating/adding comments in English*
 - *Improving global readability of the code*
 - *Changing the structure from function with librairies to class*
