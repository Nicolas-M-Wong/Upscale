# Upscale with function

The UPSCALE_FUNCTION.py is the main code, enregistrement.py and traitement_image_lib.py are referenced as libraries in UPSCALE_FUNCTION, for ease of use put these three files in the same folder.  
  
The standard name of the upscaled photo is __fraise4.jpg__ . It can be renamed inside the python code of the file name UPSCALE.py.  

*On my laptop this program upscale 256x256 picture to a 512x512 in 30 sec approximately.*
