This program is upscaling any image by a factor 2. You may need to install the following libraries to run the program:

The UPSCALE.py is the main code, enregistrement.py and traitement_image_lib.py are referenced as libraries in UPSCALE, for ease of use put these three files in the same folder.  
  
The standard name of the upscaled photo is __fraise4.jpg__ . It can be renamed inside the python code of the file name UPSCALE.py.
